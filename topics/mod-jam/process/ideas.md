# Mod jam ideas
1.  Having a timer: 1 minute timer and the player who collected the most flies win.
2. some flies will fly after than others
3. streak: after eating 5 flies consecutively, each fly the frog eats will count for 5 points instead of 1 (the flies will form a number)
4. frog eats a small bird to get extra points: fly = 1 point and bird = 2 points
5.  frog dies if it did not eat any flies after 10 seconds: eating one fly resets the time to 0
6.  the amount of flies increase when its night and decrease in the morning
7.  frog needs to stay hydrated in water, but to catch flies it has to get out of the water: the frog dries out and dies after 5 seconds without water
8. the frog can get eaten by bigger animals: bigger fishes or birds, reptiles or by other frogs...
9. frog can be blue: poisonous frog but the frog is slowly dying from poison and needs to catch a special blue bird so that it doesnt die
10. frog can eat special insects to change colors to unlock powers to eat more flies: ice powers to freeze the flies in place for a few seconds. The powers only last about 5 to 10 seconds
11.  birds compete with the frogs for flies to eat: the birds will try to attack the frog and if the frog takes on too much damage, it dies
12. if the frog ate 3 flies consecutively and the bird attacks, the frog kills the bird
13. some flies are poisonous and will kill the frog if it eats too many bad flies: black flies are normal and green flies are poisonous. The frog can eat bad flies to avoid starving to death,however if it eats more 3 bad flies the frog will die.
14. one of the powers the frog can get is immunity from poison and attacks
15. at night there will be hunters hunting for the frog with a flashlight: if the frog gets caught it has a 50% chance of getting shot and killed
16. there is a time out zone if the player clicks space: time out lasts 10 seconds max
17. there will be different game modes for each season (spring,summer,fall,winter): each season will have different types of flies and unlock new powers for the frog
18. number of flies will double when it's raining and the risk of the frog drying out will drop to 0: only lasts 3 to 5 seconds
19. if the frog doesnt move enough when it's too cold, it will freeze to death
20. the frog can eat flowers during the spring to make up for the lack of flies
