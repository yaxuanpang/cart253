# Mod jam ideas

- having a timer: 1 minute timer and the player who collected the most flies win
- streak: after eating 5 flies consecutively, each fly the frog eats will count for 5 points instead of 1 (the flies will form a number)
-  frog eats a small bird to get extra points: fly = 1 point and bird = 2 points
- frog dies if it did not eat any flies after 10 seconds: eating one fly resets the time to 0
- the amount of flies increase when its night and decrease in the morning
- frog needs to stay hydrated in water, but to catch flies it has to get out of the water: the frog dries out and dies after 5 seconds without water
- the frog can get eaten by bigger animals: bigger fishes or birds, reptiles or by other frogs...
- frog can be blue: poisonous frog but the frog is slowly dying from poison and needs to catch a special blue bird so that it doesnt die
- frog can eat special insects to change colors to unlock powers to eat more flies: ice powers to freeze the flies in place for a few seconds
