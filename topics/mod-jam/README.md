## Description

This description should help the reader understand what the program is, anything they should know to be able to experience it (controls, special features, etc.), and what the desired user experience is. For example:

> Move the frog some side to side with the mouse and click space to launch the tongue.

> The frog changes colors when it gets hurt (by birds or starvation). It starts to die if it does not eat for 3 seconds. After 5 seconds of eating the bird, the frog will start healing.

>  There is a night and day cycle with a ring in the top left corner that tracks the number of days the frog survives. It makes a full rotation after one full day and updates the number of days the frog has lived. 

> At night, a flashlight will appear. If the flashlight overlaps with the frog, it dies.
