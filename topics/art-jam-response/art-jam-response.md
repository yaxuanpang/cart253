This project was very colourful and eye-catching. Although the interaction was simple, it represented Nerly’s personality really well. It had a hatsume miku vocaloid aesthetic, which reflects her style in real life. Nerly wears a lot of bright colors and her overall style is similar to the vocaloid aesthetic. Also, the music notes hints at her love for music and their small movements makes the whole piece more dynamic. I know she wanted to make the notes play music so, I would love to see another version of the project with the music she coded. The lines in the hair were similar to guitar strings. It would be interesting to see the hair guitar play music using the white circles as a guitar pick. Lastly, the unicorn horn adds a nice pop of color. The overall image has a lot of blue, so the pink and purple in the horn with the red outline is really eye-catching. The color change of the outline is really fun to play with too. I like that she included something more abstract in her project like the unicorn horn, since I got to know more about her interests. In short, I appreciate how she included her style and personality in this project.

This project immediately caught my attention. The overall image is simplistic, but I really enjoy the soft and pastel colors. The hair looks like a big fluffy blanket and the character looks so relaxed. It reminds me of myself sleeping in during winter break with a thick blanket. I like how the snowflakes turn into flowers so smoothly when the mouse is on the left of the canvas. The background color is also so beautiful. I spent a lot of time admiring the color change from pastel blue to green and the shades of blue-green in between. I like how the user can control how the transition of seasons and how many snowflakes or flowers are on the screen. I love how Christie included a part of her name and her favorite season in the project, it makes the entirety of the project have a deeper meaning and more personal to her. I like the detail of the blush color getting more intense when the user presses “c” to show the coldness of winter and her happiness in spring. It would have been interesting to see the snowflakes/flowers falling from top to bottom instead of remaining in place. It would have made the project more dynamic and interesting in my opinion. Overall, I really appreciate the attention to detail in the character and the interaction.

At first, this project was not particularly eye-catching to me since there were not any bright colors or areas that I found very intriguing. However, I found myself entranced by the subtle movements of the body and the hair. I spent a long time looking at the flowing hair, because the way it moved was very satisfying. It reminded me of the ocean and the waves. The motion made me want to stare at it more and it captured my attention in a unique way. I like that the body is moving as well. It seemed like the character was floating in space. It felt more alive, because it was not just standing there. In addition, I like how Jason made the character blink on top of making the eyes follow the mouse. It is a feature I would like to add to my own project. I love the facial expressions of the character. The happy face was not just a smile, but it had dimples and the sad face was more like a pout than an upside down smile. I like how he chose to portray very common emotions, not in a generic way, but with his own understanding of these emotions. In short, this project was dynamic and intriguing in a unique way with a lot of attention to details.
